- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @8r34kf457
- I am a first year Compsci student, my goal is to learn programming and networking in order to get a job in cybersecurity.
- This semester I am taking Java programming and logic, Math gen ed, and intro to computer information systems.
- I'm very self motivated when it comes to learning but I am not very good at programming yet, there is a lot I still need to learn.
Having a learning disability has made learning code challenging, but I am determined to prove to myself that I can be successful.
-Caffeine of choice: pineapple redbull, coldbrew, and watermelon Reign.
